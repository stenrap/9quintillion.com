The analysis tool must:

    - Accept this password as input: 1Billion$ars

	- Accept a year as input
	
	- Load the bracket for the specified year, parse all 64 teams, and store them in that year's table of teams:

			+ (2014) http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/tournament/bracket/_/id/201422/2014-ncaa-mens-final-4-tournament
			   ....                                                                       ^^     ^^

		It appears that the entire bracket is a _single_ line of HTML!


	=====

	  Determine start of bracket

	    <div id="bracket"

	=====


	=====

	  Determine each winner and loser

	    =====

		Actual HTML of a single game with the winner on top in the first two rounds (2002):

		    <dl id="match1" class="match round1 winnertop"><dt><b>1 <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/150/duke-blue-devils" title="Duke">Duke</a></b><br/>16 <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2737/winthrop-eagles" title="Winthrop">Winthrop</a></dt><dd class="pointer" onclick="toGamePage(224000047,3);"><b>84</b><br/>37</dd></dl>

		Which means when the winner is on top, the top team can be derived from this pattern:

            <dt><b>1 <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/150/duke-blue-devils" title="Duke">Duke</a></b>

        And the bottom team can be derived from this pattern (again, winner on top):

            <br/>16 <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2737/winthrop-eagles" title="Winthrop">Winthrop</a></dt>

        =====

        Actual HTML of a single game with the loser on top in the first two rounds (2014):

            <dl id="match2" class="match round1 winnerbot"><dt>8 <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/38/colorado-buffaloes" title="Colorado">Colorado</a><br/><b>9 <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/221/pittsburgh-panthers" title="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a></b></dt><dd class="pointer" onclick="toGamePage(400546916,3);">48<br/><b>77</b></dd></dl>

        Which means when the loser is on top, the top team can be derived from this pattern:

            <dt>8 <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/38/colorado-buffaloes" title="Colorado">Colorado</a>

        And the bottom team can be derived from this pattern (again, loser on top):

            <br/><b>9 <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/221/pittsburgh-panthers" title="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a></b></dt>

        =====

        Actual HTML of the remaining games (sweet sixteen, elite eight, final four, championship) with the loser on top (2002):

            <div id="match13" class="match round3 winnerbot"><dl><dt>1 <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/150/duke-blue-devils" title="Duke">Duke</a><br/><b>5 <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/84/indiana-hoosiers" title="Indiana">Indiana</a></b></dt><dd class="pointer" onclick="toGamePage(224000053,3);">73<br/><b>74</b></dd></dl></div>

        Actual HTML of the remaining games (sweet sixteen, elite eight, final four, championship) with the winner on top (2014):

            <div id="match13" class="match round3 winnertop"><dl><dt><b>1 <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/57/florida-gators" title="Florida">Florida</a></b><br/>4 <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/26/ucla-bruins" title="UCLA">UCLA</a></dt><dd class="pointer" onclick="toGamePage(400548873,3);"><b>79</b><br/>68</dd></dl></div>

	- Display a table of all the above statistics for each winning team (so there should be 63 rows). In each row, indicate whether
	  the winning team was better or worse for each statistic. This *should* allow you to visually determine what the weight of each
	  statistics should be, so that:
	  
	  	a) You can either win $1,000,000,000 or $100,000!
	  	
	  	b) You can provide true value to those who might pay to use the prognostication services provided by your site!


==================
	Prediction
==================

	- NOTE: Remember that you can get the Average Points Allowed for the current year -- and this will be a *nice* 20th stat to add!
			However, this will mean loading and parsing the "Clubhouse" page instead of the "Statistics" page above (darn).
